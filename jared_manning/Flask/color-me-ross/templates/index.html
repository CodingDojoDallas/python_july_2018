    <p>What the devil. Let's build an almighty mountain. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.

        There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Trees grow however makes them happy. This piece of canvas is your world. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
        
        Don't fight it, use what happens. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Let's do that again. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.
        
        The light is your friend. Preserve it. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
        
        Son of a gun. It is a lot of fun. You have to make these big decisions.
        
        Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. We'll do another happy little painting. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
        
        Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.
