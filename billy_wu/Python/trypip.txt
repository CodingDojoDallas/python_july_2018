deactivate (This will deactivate your virtual environment)
// deactivates virutal environment

pip3 list (How is the result different from when you ran pip list with the virtualenv activated? Hint, you should not have as many things listed when the virtualenv is deactivated. If your results are the same, go back and figure out what went wrong.)
// similar to previous list, but without the Django virtual environment

source myEnvironments/py3Env/bin/activate (Adjust the path as needed to re-activate the virtualenv; for windows call myEnvironments/py3Env/Scripts/activate)

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)
// freeze outputs the format required for pip to understand

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?

pip uninstall Django
// uninstalls Django

pip show Django
// nothing showed up
